# ProsperCraft-Avorion-Modpack
A spot to keep the modpack running on the ProsperCraft Avorion server.

This is the modpack for the Prospercrft Avorion server.

Mostly this is just some new factories, but there are a few other goodies as well.  Notably the mod to make claimable asteroids move.
I believe that the move asteroids and some of the other commands included here are not needed clientside, but lacking any testing I've included them.

To properly install this pack, you will need to unzip it into your Avorion folder.
By default this is in Steam/Steamapps/common/Avorion  There is also a drive letter and other folders where you installed Steam itself.
If you can't find those out, maybe the modpack isn't for you.  I'm going to assume you have at least basic knowledge on how to move files.

When unzipped into the base Avorion folder, it will merge the data folder in the archive with the one in your game folder and ask about
overwriting files.  Answer as you see fit, but the most important ones to get access to our factories are goodsindex.lua and
productionsindex.lua.  It will also install a "mods" folder that should contain the graphics for the PizzaPlus mod and the files 
needed for Moving asteroids.

If you wind up with Avorion/data/data then you did it wrong and the mod won't work.

Most of the new factories added are food related, all starting with the idea of adding a pizza factory and spiraling out of control
from there.  The acutal prices on things are still a bit up in the air as I need to see some real world testing to figure out if
the profit margins are ok and not over powered.  There are a few other factories added, two from Lazerzwei's All Production Chains, and
a few specific to Prospercraft.  You should be able to trade with our factories without having the mod installed, but if you want to build
any of them you will need it on your client.

I will try to keep this updated, but the modpack is also available on www.prospercraft.com discord server.  Go to the website and sign
up for access.  There is a link to the discord there, then join us in the #avorion channel where all the latest server information
and discussion takes place.  Rules and the modpack are pinned in that channel.
