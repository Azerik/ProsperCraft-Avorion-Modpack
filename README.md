# ProsperCraft-Avorion-Modpack

This is our modpack.  Because of some file removals there is a new installation procedure.

Open up Windoze Explorer or whatever file management you use.

Go to the Avorion game directory (default Steam/steamapps/common/Avorion).

Go into the "data" folder and delete the "scripts" folder.

Fire up Steam.
Right click Avorion in the game list.
Choose Properties.
Go to the Local Files tab.  
Choose Verify Files.

This should get Steam to download new copies of your files for Avorion.  The total download with the binaries is only a few hundred megs, the scripts folder is barely anything.  My rural DSL does it so fast I barely notice it has happened.

Go back to your file manager, find the modpack and unzip it into the main Avorion folder.  There should be a notice that pops up that asks about replacing files already there, let it replace them all.  If you don't get that pop up asking about those files, then you are unzipping into the wrong folder.  (again, default is Steam/steamapps/common/Avorion)

There have been some files removed since the last modpack and this should get the previous versions of those files out of your folder.

Mostly this adds a new supply chain or three of custom factories, but there are some other quality of life mods in there too.  More to come as mods get updated to work with the newest patch.
