Unzip this into your Avorion folder. (default Program Files(x86)\Steam\Steamapps\common\Avorion)

If you did it correctly, there should be a bunch of files asking permission to overwrite things.  If you don't get that, you put it in the wrong folder.
Alternatively unzip it wherever and select the "data" and "mods" folder and copy those into your Avorion folder.
